# Caesar Cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift,
is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

To encrypt or decrypt a message you need a key that makes the shift of the letters.

### Encrypt the message

`python caesar-cipher.py` -> Choose `Option 1` and give the required input (`message` and the `key`)

### Decrypt the message

`python algorithm.py` -> Choose `Option 2` and give the required input (`message` and the `key`)

### Brute force the caesar cipher

`python brute-force-caesar-cipher.py` -> Enter your secret message and the program will try all the keys to decrypt the message.
